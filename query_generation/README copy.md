# SQL Query Generator

## Overview

This project serves as an SQL Query Generator comprising two main steps: SQL specification generation and query generation from specification. It contains modules dedicated to different components of SQL queries, including GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE, JOIN, LIMIT, ORDER BY, limit, among others. You can see more information about the sql generator in [query_generator](.Query_generator.pdf)

## Usage

The project focuses on generating SQL queries based on various specifications. It provides modularity with separate modules for different SQL query components, enabling easy extension and modification.

## Getting Started

1. **Change configurations based on your desire in [config_file.json](./config_file.json)**: 
   Configure settings as required within the `config_file.json` to align with your project requirements.

2. **Generate Queries from Specifications**: Run the following command to generate queries using the created specifications:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd query_generation
    python3 query_generator_from_specifications.py
    ```

## Folder Structure

The `output` folder is referenced for storing project-generated output files.
