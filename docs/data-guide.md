# Data guide

The repository distinguishes between *raw* assets sourced from public benchmarks and *processed* artefacts generated by the synthesis pipelines.

## Raw assets (`data/raw`)

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tables.json`, `tables22.json` | Canonical Spider schema definitions used for SQL parsing and generation. |
| `train_spider.json`, `dev.json`, `dev22.json` | Spider query splits for training and evaluation. |

These files should remain immutable; upstream updates can be dropped in by replacing the corresponding JSON files.

## Processed artefacts (`data/processed`)

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `synthetic_queries/` | Hierarchical folder containing generated SQL statements broken down by synthesis strategy (e.g. `schema_guided`, `llm_based`). The reorganisation updates all code to point to this location. |
| `join_relationship/` | Intermediate files that describe table join relationships discovered during preprocessing. |
| `farm_queries.txt` | Example derived dataset produced by the synthesis scripts. |

## Archives (`data/archives`)

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `synthetic_queries.zip` | Frozen snapshot of synthetic query outputs. Useful for reproducing experiments without re-running the full pipeline. |

## External corpora

Large datasets such as `spider` and `test-suite-sql-eval-master` are kept at the repository root because their internal tooling expects the historical folder names. The analysis modules translate those paths using `Path` objects to keep the new layout self-consistent.

For more context on how these resources are consumed, see [`docs/module-map.md`](module-map.md) and [`docs/workflows/evaluation.md`](workflows/evaluation.md).
