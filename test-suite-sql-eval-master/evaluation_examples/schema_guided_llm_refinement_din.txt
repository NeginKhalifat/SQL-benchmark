SELECT The provided SQL query appears to correctly implement the requirements of the question. It joins the `death` and `ship` tables on the appropriate foreign key (`death.caused_by_ship_id = ship.id`), filters the `death` records based on the condition (`death.id >= 50`), and selects the relevant columns (`death.id` and `ship.lost_in_battle`). There is no need for `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, or `DESC` based on the question's requirements. The query does not include any redundant columns in the `GROUP BY` clause, and it correctly uses the columns mentioned in the `SELECT` statement.	battle_death
