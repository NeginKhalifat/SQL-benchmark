Note: The query has been refined to correct the errors mentioned in the feedback. The join condition has been corrected to match the foreign key relationship between the tables. The WHERE clause has been corrected to reference the book_club_id from the book_club table. The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses have been modified to include both Publisher and Group_Equity_Shareholding to uniquely identify each row."
